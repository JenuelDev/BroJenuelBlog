Hi ✋😁
I would like to introduce my self,
my name is Jenuel Oras Ganawed and I am a web developer.

I wrote this article to share my new portfolio.

I was searching for designs on google for a couple of days, and then I stumbled on a good design that I like. Its a design by Brittany Chiang.

I built my portfolio based on her design using Vue Js, and with the help of the plugin Vuetify. I tweaked my portfolio a little with the taste that I like.

You can check my the website [here](https://jenuelganawed.ml)
you can also check the Github [here](https://github.com/BroJenuel/jenuel-portfolio-v2)

You can use my use it whatever you like but don't forget to credit me, and especially Brittany Chiang the designer.
